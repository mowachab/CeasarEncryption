# Ceasar encryption 
simple web app showcasing one of the earliest techniques of encryption 

The Ceasar cipher is an ancient cryptography technique and is said to have been used by Julius Ceasar during his reign.  

# How it works :
The user enter the prompt to be encrypted and chose a shift, each letter in the alphabet is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions(**shift**) down the alphabet.
For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, E would become F, and so on.

# Important
This encryption method can be easily brute forced given the limited shifts possible(26).
